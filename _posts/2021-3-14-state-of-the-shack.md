With some new additions to my amateur radio shack, I thought I'd post some photos of the space and talk about my plans for the immediate future in radio.

Starting off with my handhelds atop the power supply, I use my Yaesu FT-65R almost daily. I enjoy using it to check-in with local nets for ARES and my local club, as well as monitor my closest repeaters. Still trying to work off that local mic fright, but I have a feeling once I get more comfortable with my ARES crew that'll be a lot easier. Next to it, I have my Radioditty GD-77 for DMR. I love spending time on Brandmeister talkgroups with people from around the world. It's a fun way to stay engaged with the amateur radio community as a whole while only being a technician! Not pictured is my custom PiStar hotspot attached to my wall, running Brandmeister and a private DMR network for experiementing.

Also not pictured is my mobile radio setup. I have a TRAM Mag Mount antenna for 2m and 70cm mounted on my car's trunk and the coax routed in through my rear seats. On the end of the coax I have a BNC adapter hooked up, typically with a Baofeng UV-5R attached in the car but can also be quickly attached to my FT-65R. I'm currently searching for a better mobile setup, but for monitoring repeaters on the go it does a great job.

My new addition to the shack is the base station tranceiver pictured in the photo. It is an Icom IC-737 connected to an ASTRON RS-20A power supply. The 737 is my first step into HF communications while I study for my general class license.

My plans for the immediate future in ham radio consist of:
* Finish the in-progress 2m Yagi antenna
* Get an HF antenna and listen in on an HF net
* Explore Emergency Communications in-depth for my Capstone project
