ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Glad you stumbled upon my website!

## Quick Bio

My name is Colin, I am a 17 year old amateur radio operator with a QTH in Nashville, TN and a Technician class license. My interests in radio are wide-spread, but focused on the software side of things.

## Interests in Radio

### DMR

I enjoy working with DMR and other digital modes! My current setup for DMR is a Radioddity GD-77 running the OpenGD77 firmware and a [custom-built Pi-Star hotspot](/2021/01/26/my-dmr-hotspot/). 

You can typically catch me in Brandmeister talkgroups 98638 and 31621. I typically check-in at the weekly Ham Radio Village net at 8pm CT Tuesday nights on TG98638.

My upcoming goals in DMR and digital voice are: 
- [ ] Upgrade to the Anytone 878 radio for DMR
- [ ] Get more radios for operating other modes (D-Star, YSF)
- [ ] Build my own small-scale DMR network

### Satellites

Working stations all over the world on Satellite passes with VHF/UHF seems very intriguing to me! At the moment, I am working on building up the capability to work satellites - if you've stumbled on this page after working me on a satellite let me know to update it!

I currently listen to satellites with a Baofeng UV-5R and a DIY tape measure yagi antenna built for 2m. I'm looking to get a Duplex setup going and then move to making contacts if possible!

### DXing

As of last updating this page - I am studying for my General class license and trying to get my hands on an HF station. Once I move to HF, I plan on trying to make many long distance contacts over SSB Voice, FT8, and JS8Call.

Below will be an updated count of my progress towards various awards! Hopefully I will soon be able to automate this.

<!-- TODO: Can this be automated? -->

* DXCC - 0/100
