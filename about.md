ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Glad you've stumbled upon my website!

## About Me

I'm Colin, a 17 year old amateur radio operator currently based out of Nashville, TN. Currently, I spend my time listening in to activity on VHF/UHF repeaters near me. 

I enjoy writing about programming and self-care at my website [Mystic Speech](https://mysticspeech.com). I'm [@KO4JZT](https://twitter.com/ko4jzt) on Twitter now, happy to reply to anything that comes my way! Made a contact with me and want to reach out? Feel free to email me on the public email address in the footer or on my [QRZ page](https://www.qrz.com/db/KO4JZT).

My primary interests in radio include:
- Digital Voice Methods (DMR, YSF, D-Star, etc.)
- Satellite Communications
- Custom Antenna Design
- CW

### My History in Radio

December 2020 - Technician License Acquired as KO4JZT

### My Equipment

I primarily use a Baofeng UV-5R as an everyday carry radio, with an 18-inch ABBREE SMA-Female antenna attached to it. I use this to scan a variety of local repeaters and simplex frequencies when I'm at home and out and about to see what I can pick up.

I also have a Radioddity GD-77 DMR HT running OpenGD77 firmware for DMR communications. I use this occasionally, but there are not as many DMR repeaters near me that I can hit with a 5W HT, so I am waiting till I have a local PiStar hotspot to use. I keep a Nagoya NA-771 SMA-Male antenna on this radio.

My dream radios are a Yaesu FT-2DR and the Kenwood TH-D74A handhelds.
