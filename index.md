# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Colin/Bender.

I'm all of the following things in this world:

* Freelance Developer (Wordpress, Node.js, misc. projects)
* Full-Stack Web Developer
* Amateur Radio Operator
* Really Bad Guitarist
* Life-long learner
* Nerd about the following: 3d printing, devops, NBC's *Chuck*, productivity, psychology 

At the moment - I'm working 100% freelance on projects involving the web. Wordpress, Node.js, Jekyll, you name it. If you want to work with me, feel free to shoot me an email over at colin [at] cpdev [dot] me. 

# ðŸ“» Amateur Radio

You might be wondering, what does KO4JZT mean? It's my amateur radio callsign - licensed as of December 2020. If you're a ham too, feel free to try and make a contact with me! 

<!-- TODO: Automate this. -->
I'm currently active on a few local repeaters in the Nashville area, as well as some Brandmeister talkgroups. Soon, I'll try and have a spot where you can currently find me automatically listed below. Until then - feel free to shoot me a message on Discord (colin#3523) to schedule a QSO!

I also write about my projects in amateur radio, from building my shack, exploring new modes, and more! Check out my blog posts on amateur radio
[here](TODO).
